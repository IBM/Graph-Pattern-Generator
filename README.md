# Graph-Pattern-Generator

This repository provides an implementation of a synthetic graph generator, which also detects and reports subgraph patterns such as 
cycles, fans, bi-cliques and scatter-gather patterns that exist in the generated graphs.

# Running the code

First, create the environment by running `conda env create -f environment_new.yml` and then activate it.
